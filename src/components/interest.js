                Fishing. Hours and hours of waiting for that one fish, and you only get one chance to catch it. One wrong move and it is gone. Sounds like many one-off situations in the workplace.
                Mountain climbing. Another activity that requires solid decision making and an innate trust in delivering your skills. If you climb as a pair, you place your life in the hands of another.
                Gardening. Lovingly preparing the ground for a flower that might only bloom for a month requires a patient eye for detail, dealing with elements that are often out of your control.
                Camping. Venturing into the great outdoors is great for the mind, and while camping might not be the most strenuous activity, it is a sign of someone who is at one with themselves.
